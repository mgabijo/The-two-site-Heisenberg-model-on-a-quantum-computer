Author: Maria Gabriela JordÃ£o Oliveira

The goal of this script is to implement the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm (IPEA) for
the two-site Heisenberg model. The Hamiltonian is given by:
H = J (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z)
where J is the coupling constant and S1 and S2 are the spin operators for the two sites.

The results are saved in pickle files.
